# UP42 API walktrough

## Preamble

This walktrough is just a scratchpad for the official [UP42](up42.com)
[documentation site](https://docs.up42.com). Always refer to that
site for the currently officialy supported API endpoints. It may
appear here API features that are not yet official or that are a work
in progress.

## Introduction

The UP42 API allows for doing the following things on a given project:

1. Work with jobs: 
   * get job(s)
   * cancel job
   * create & run job
   * get job output (`data.json`)
   * get job output directory
2. Work with jobs and tasks:
   * get job task logs
   * get job task outputs (`data.json`)
   * get job tasks output directory 
3. Work with workflows:
   * get workflows
   * get workflow
   * update workflow
   * create workflow
    
It means that a **project key** is **always** needed. Therefore you
always need to create a project **through the UI**.

The example below uses an example project. So the specific values of
things like project key and project ID are given for illustration
purposes only. In your case the values will be different.

**Note**: Please be aware that the project ID and the project key
allow anyone to manipulate your project (account) so be careful and do
not share it around. Someone might find it and besides messing with
your project it will make you incur costs and thus reduce the
currently available credits in our platform. 

## Requirements

 1. [`cURL`](https://curl.haxx.se).
 2. [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is the shell
used in this guide.

All output is given as Github
[gists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-gists#about-gists)
linked below as they are returned by the API.

The required inputs (request body) are in the `inputs` directory and the returned
outputs (response body) are in the `outputs` directory.

## Authentication: getting the token

Before attempting to do anything with the API you need to get a token
in order to perform any type of operation on your project.

```bash
# Set the project ID.
PROJ=5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff
# Set the project key.
 PKEY=aoiTOv31.hab0M74qT9cB7K57wO6ue1glddcL3t5zsxb
# Get the token.
PTOKEN=$(curl -sX POST "https://$PROJ:$PKEY@api.up42.com/oauth/token"   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' | jq -r '.data.accessToken')
```

Now you can echo the token in the shell:

```bash
echo $PTOKEN
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJraWQiOiIxIiwidG9rZW5fdHlwZSI6IkFDQ0VTUyIsImFsZyI6IlJTNTEyIn0.eyJpc3MiOiJiYWNrZW5kLWNvcmUiLCJqdGkiOiI5ZGYyMzY3MC02NDRkLTRkMGEtYTFlNi1hODIwN2QxZGQwNDgiLCJpYXQiOjE1NjE3MTc0ODcsInN1YiI6IjVhMjFlYWZmLWNkYWEtNDhhYi1iZWRmLTU0NTQxMTZkMTZmZiIsImF1ZCI6IjVhMjFlYWZmLWNkYWEtNDhhYi1iZWRmLTU0NTQxMTZkMTZmZiIsImV4cCI6MTU2MTcxNzc4NywiYXV0aG9yaXRpZXMiOlsiUlVOX0pPQiIsIlZJRVdfUFJPSkVDVCJdfQ.DLEUuifHzksf_Q_ReMF0aQXY-MOoy_nDu-noCGu7F8_Z2dBEJXbKILcvTB1t7ABVZmnd2eGlLiBuAF5zuz-L7nGuxqqzPawYy4GMB_ICc7HTuicYnx3fOGakby6qUGRuWlOmPGbcsgS_tRbt4pcjOPMvK0LbBXKobZb1HZYMdns4wiKVHE6IEyWn57k0eVm_y5fKImLIvGbqz060AakIamQ6O9uAHADOZwej9rnbkQO9e5LqP3hbb59sluyOhke0hYuJqA5VhssX743xxa3MZpxBRRhwR5YG_oxWEdOShhFq7T9S5i8fCZvhuoR3eQSkakTEfIMxLYQfDcycdptHJqXN5twtlYJ0hKTKuW0ezgELeTHtuSobg3xbZW7M8opX7lqtnnsVPVApo19ndqdaJtfTFiU1WgcveS0o47sXkPVtB7ohug420g5ux3XRCxgAY6vFHlvNWZZP6F6bSh-Ah7Gqm5jsW76DrloZyedOVz2qVoFU6XCicyXEsBSuo0giRlVHnVtRmqmHbTvyxFjndTbsoahxSH2rKX4H1AWjIyw_jEcZGBx4XZG2dWPYSNOR1SCx59i4XL9BzTVywjxNt50MpV92eIRI7doNSK-UXo6DClrXPl8-VskJrS_fTjyK-qD8P1tCHYs8eytnfKG0BZwrlhYAVYMHumvOtxxG0NE
```

This token is valid for **5** minutes. To get a new token repeat the
cURL request above. 

**Note**: Since Bash does not record in the shell history all commands
started with a space we recommend you set the `PKEY` variable above
such that the line start with a space like done here.

## Working with jobs

### List all the jobs for a given project

```bash
curl -L -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/jobs" | jq '.' > jobs_$PROJ.json
```

This creates the following
[`jobs_5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff.json`](https://gist.github.com/perusio/4e228693b0e0c10492d7ccc706d69a2a) file.


### Create and run a job {#create-run-job}

To create and run a job you need to get first the workflow IDs. 

```bash
WORKFLOW=$(curl -L -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/jobs" | jq -j '.data[0] | .workflow.id')
```

that returns a single element, since there is only one workflow for this
project: 

```bash
echo $WORKFLOW 21415975-390f-4215-becb-8d46aaf5156c
```

You also need to get the job parameters. In this case you are just copying
from a previous job. Using the previously saved job list.

```bash
cat jobs_5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff.json | jq '.data[0].inputs' > job_params_5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff.json
```

The first returned job parameters are:

```js
{
    "land_cover_classification:1": {
        "n_clusters": 6,
        "n_iterations": 10,
        "n_sieve_pixels": 64
    },
    "sentinelhub-landsat8-aoiclipped:1": {
        "bbox": null,
        "time": null,
        "limit": 1,
        "intersects": {
            "type": "Polygon",
            "coordinates": [
                [
                    [
                        -8.877645,
                        40.152078
                    ],
                    [
                        -8.871337,
                        40.139659
                    ],
                    [
                        -8.849105,
                        40.141048
                    ],
                    [
                        -8.860468,
                        40.152447
                    ],
                    [
                        -8.877645,
                        40.152078
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        },
        "zoom_level": 17
    }
}

```

Finally you can create and run the job:

```bash
# Create the URL as variable.
URL_POST_JOB="https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/workflows/$WORKFLOW/jobs"
curl -s -L -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $URL_POST_JOB -d @job_params_5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff.json
```

You can see the job parameters [here](https://gist.github.com/perusio/fc948f4876897968e6d7e345f79ee0da).

### Get the previously launched job information

Now that a job is launched to obtain information on it you query the
API the following way:

```bash
# Job URL.
URL_JOB_INFO=https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/jobs/$JOB"
# Variable with the job ID.
JOB=96b4c117-ab4d-44cf-afb1-0922d91031d4
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" $URL_JOB_INFO | jq '.' > jobs_job-$JOB.json
```

It returns the
[JSON](https://gist.github.com/perusio/e4e00cd7190ed97da3f25f78600c042e)
containing all the job information.

### Get the job status

Now filter the previous request to get the job status.

```bash
curl -L -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/jobs/96b4c117-ab4d-44cf-afb1-0922d91031d4" | jq -r '.data.status'
```
In this case it returns:

```bash
RUNNING
```

This means that the job is still running.

### Get the jobs logs

To get the log of a running job you first need to identify the task
that is running. For that you use `jq` to query the previously
saved file containing the job information.

```bash
TASK=$(cat jobs_job-96b4c117-ab4d-44cf-afb1-0922d91031d4.json | jq -j '.data.tasks[] as $task | if $task.status == "RUNNING" then $task.id else "" end')
```

It returns:

```bash
echo $TASK
24c78a98-3def-4ee5-853d-2d5150757f2b
```

```bash
RUNNING_TASK_URL="https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/jobs/$JOB/tasks/$TASK"
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' "$RUNNING_TASK_URL/logs" > task_log-$TASK.txt
```

This command returns the log file available at [`https://gist.github.com/perusio/60639d67a47e241cdc8356d8c30a1ff9`](https://gist.github.com/perusio/60639d67a47e241cdc8356d8c30a1ff9).

### Get the job results

Once the job completes you can query the API to get the results.
Obtaining the [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) file and/or the output directory delivered as a
[gzipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) [tarball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)).

#### Get the results: GeoJSON

```bash
OUTPUT_URL="https://api.up42.com/projects/$PROJ/jobs/$JOB/outputs"
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "$OUTPUT_URL/data-json"  | jq '.' > output-$JOB.json
```

Produces this [output](https://gist.github.com/perusio/4597361dc4792dfdda8a7260b39e9baf).


### Get the results: tarball

```bash
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -o output-$JOB.tar.gz "$OUTPUT_URL/directory"
```

Inspect the retrieved tarball:

```bash
> tar tar ztvf output_$JOB.tar.gz

drwxrwxrwx  0 root   root        0 Jul  3 00:39 output
-rw-r--r--  0 root   root   432316 Jul  3 00:39 output/data.json
-rw-r--r--  0 root   root  5515635 Jul  3 00:39 output/e3650bac-bfbe-4ed2-bec4-9ea50245d2c0_land_cover.tif

```

There is both the GeoJSON file and the output as a
[GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) file. The file name
is constructed from the first task ID and part of the block name. See
below for an explanation of what tasks are.

### Get individual tasks results

The job is composed of two tasks, each corresponding to a block in the
workflow: the first is obtaining the [Landsat 8](https://up42.com/marketplace/block/95519b2d-09d7-4cd0-a321-4d6a46bef6c1)
data, the second is runnning the [Land cover classification](https://up42.com/marketplace/block/ae2113e8-05df-41e6-9871-5d782705d8e1). We
can obtain the partial results, i.e., we can get the results from each
task in the job.

The task results are again given as a GeoJSON file and/or a tarball as
they are for a job result.

Iterating through the tasks in the job file.

```bash
cat jobs_job-$JOB.json | jq -r '.data.tasks[] | .id  + "_" + .name'
```

which outputs:

```bash
3344b712-aa9a-4cdb-94ae-7f3e379b7369 sentinelhub-landsat8-aoiclipped:1
24c78a98-3def-4ee5-853d-2d5150757f2b land_cover_classification:1
```

The first is the task ID and the second is the task name, clearly
identifying the task ID and what it corresponds to in terms of the
workflow.

Create two shell variables, one for each task:

```bash
TASK1=$(cat jobs_job-$JOB.json | jq -j '.data.tasks[0] | .id')
TASK2=$(cat jobs_job-$JOB.json | jq -j '.data.tasks[1] | .id')
```

```bash
> echo $TASK1 $TASK2

3344b712-aa9a-4cdb-94ae-7f3e379b7369 24c78a98-3def-4ee5-853d-2d5150757f2b
```

Now with the individual tasks IDs let us proceed to get the
respective results.

##### First task results: GeoJSON

The first task is the Landsat 8 data acquisition. The output GeoJSON
is:

```bash
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "$TASK1_URL/outputs/data-json" | jq '.' > output_task-$TASK1.json
```

returning the following [file](https://gist.github.com/perusio/f9407da92c65a1bcb76621b658185ad6).


##### First task results: tarball

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -o output_$TASK1.tar.gz "$TASK1_URL/outputs/directory"

```

Inspecting the tarball:

```bash
> tar ztvf output_$TASK1.tar.gz
drwxrwxrwx  0 root   root        0 Jul  3 00:23 output

-rw-r--r--  0 root   root    36197 Jul  3 00:23 output/data.json
-rw-r--r--  0 root   root 132209093 Jul  3 00:23 output/e3650bac-bfbe-4ed2-bec4-9ea50245d2c0.tif
```

you can see the resulting Landsat 8 GeoTIFF image there.

##### Second task results: GeoJSON


```bash
 curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "$TASK2_URL/outputs/data-json" | jq '.' > output_task-$TASK2.json
```

This will be the same GeoJSON as we got above for the job
results. They may look sintatically different, but semantically they
are the same, as you can confirm in this [gist](96b4c117-ab4d-44cf-afb1-0922d91031d4).


##### Second task results: tarball

Similarly for the tarball:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -o output_task-$TASK2.tar.gz "$TASK2_URL/outputs/directory"
```

```bash
> tar ztvf output_task-$TASK2.tar.gz

drwxrwxrwx  0 root   root        0 Jul  3 00:39 output
-rw-r--r--  0 root   root   432316 Jul  3 00:39 output/data.json
-rw-r--r--  0 root   root  5515635 Jul  3 00:39 output/e3650bac-bfbe-4ed2-bec4-9ea50245d2c0_land_cover.tif
```

As you can see the results are the same as for the job. Which means that:

> the final task of a workflow produces the same results as the job
> itself

## Workflow API

The workflow API allows you to manipulate workflows. You can do all
[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
operations on workflows.

### Get all the workflows

```bash
URL_WORKFLOWS="https://api.up42.dev/projects/$PROJ/workflows"
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" $URL_WORKFLOWS | jq '.' > workflows-$PROJ.json
```

[This](https://gist.github.com/perusio/3a5bd15878caa25f99e8d12e2a1774d5)
is the output file.

In this case there is only one workflow. You can verifiy this by
issuing the following command:

```bash
cat workflows-5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff.json | jq '.data | length'
```

giving `1`. Hence it is confirmed that there is a single workflow in
this project.

Extracting the workflow ID:

```bash
cat workflows-5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff.json | jq -j '.data[] | .id'
```
returns:

```bash
21415975-390f-4215-becb-8d46aaf5156c
```

As you can see it is the same workflow ID as we extracted before in
[creating and running the job](#create-run-job).

### Get a particular workflow

Now reusing the `WORKFLOW` variable from above to obtain the details
for a particular workflow.

```bash
curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" "$URL_WORKFLOWS/$WORKFLOW" | jq '.' > workflow-$WORKFLOW.json
```

Returns the [file](https://gist.github.com/perusio/7c8ec9f06de6be3695e04a0b627b1535).

### Create a workflow

You can think of workflow creation as being an operation consiting of
two steps:

 1. Create the workflow resource via a POST request.
 2. Populate that resource via a PUT request.

#### POST request: creating the resource

To create a new workflow we need to give a JSON as the request body.

```js
{
  "id": null,
  "name": "Create a new landsat 8 + Land cover workflow",
  "description": "Just trying out workflow creation",
  "projectId": "5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff",
  "tasks": []
}
```

as you can see we have the following fields:

 + `id`: the workflow ID, it is `null` because the ID will be given in the response once the resource is created.
 + `name`: the name you want to give to the workflow.
 + `description`: the workflow description.
 + `projectId`: the project ID we defined above.
 + `tasks`: the tasks in this workflow. Since we just created the
   workflow this is currently empty. Therefore we set it to an empty array.

Issuing the request:

```bash
curl -s -L -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $URL_WORKFLOWS -d @create_new_workflow.json | jq '.' > workflow-created-response.json
```

And this is the response body.

```js
{
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "id": "ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c",
    "name": "Create a new landsat 8 + Land cover workflow",
    "description": "Just trying out workflow creation",
    "tasks": [],
    "createdAt": "2019-07-10T17:51:26.371Z",
    "updatedAt": "2019-07-10T17:51:26.375Z",
    "totalProcessingTime": 0
  }
}

```

The resource has been created with the ID
`ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c`.

The ID is the last component of the URL when creating tasks, since it refers to a
specific resource: the just created workflow.

It is useful to store it in a variable:

```bash
NEW_WORKFLOW=$(cat workflow-created-response.json | jq -j '.data.id')
```

To confirm the value:

```bash
> echo $NEW_WORKFLOW

ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c
```

Now using the ID you can populate the workflow with the tasks. Task
creation will be done one by one. Since the workflow has two tasks
there are two separate PUT requests.
  
#### Creating the the first task: data block addition
 
Adding the data block: Landsat 8 AOI clipped.

First you need to create the response body for the PUT request.

```js
{
  "id": "ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c",
  "name": "Create a new landsat 8 + Land cover workflow",
  "description": "Just trying out workflow creation",
  "projectId": "5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "First task_ Landsat 8 AOI clipped data block",
      "parentName": null,
      "blockName": "sentinelhub-landsat8-aoiclipped"
    }
  ]
}

```

where we have the fields given when creating the workflow resource
(POST request) plus the workflow ID and the first task specific fields:

 + `name`: the task name.
 + `parentName`: the name of the parent task, i.e., the task that
   precedes the current task. Since this is the first task, it is
   `null`.
 + `blockName`: the block machine name. 

Now issuing the request:

```bash
curl -L -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "$URL_WORKFLOWS/$NEW_WORKFLOW" -d @create_task1_workflow-ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c.json | jq '.' > workflow_task1_created-$NEW_WORKFLOW.json
```

generates the [response body](https://gist.github.com/perusio/d544bfc158035c483867fa74a9697ef8).
 
The workflow has now the first task in place.

#### Creating the the second task: processing block addition

Adding the processing block: Land cover classification. 
 
The new  block needs to be added to the task list (a JS array).

```js
{
  "id": "ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c",
  "name": "Create a new landsat 8 + Land cover workflow",
  "description": "Just trying out workflow creation",
  "projectId": "5a21eaff-cdaa-48ab-bedf-5454116d16ff",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "First task_ Landsat 8 AOI clipped data block",
      "parentName": null,
      "blockName": "sentinelhub-landsat8-aoiclipped"
    },
   {
     "name": "land_cover_classification:1",
     "parentName": "First task_ Landsat 8 AOI clipped data block",
     "blockName": "land_cover_classification"
   }
  ]
}

```

The task list has now two entries, the second being the
`land_cover_classification` block. Notice that `parentName` is set to
be the first task in the workflow: `First task Landsat 8 AOI-Clipped
data block`.

To add the second block the API call is:

```bash
curl -L -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "$URL_WORKFLOWS/$NEW_WORKFLOW" -d @create_task2_workflow-ce6f6b93-f227-42d8-b998-a043762c8c5c.json | jq '.' > workflow_task2_created-$NEW_WORKFLOW.json
```

that outputs the following
[file](https://gist.github.com/perusio/d27bd895bc383635b4e4b3d1469bdebb)
in the response body.

Now querying the workflow endpoint:

```bash
curl -L -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "$URL_WORKFLOWS/$NEW_WORKFLOW" | jq '.' > workflow-$NEW_WORKFLOW.json
```
